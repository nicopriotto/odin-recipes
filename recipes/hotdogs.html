    <h1>Spooky Spider Halloween Hot Dogs</h1>
    <img src="../img/hotdogs.jpg" alt="Spooky Spider Halloween Hot Dogs Finished Dish">
    <p>Use crescent rolls and hot dogs to make this Halloween version of pigs in a blanket. Kids love them, and they are an easy snack for a Halloween party.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>1 (8 ounce) can refrigerated crescent rolls</li>
            <li>8 hot dogs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ketchup, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Unroll crescent dough. Pinch or press the perforation between the triangles to get 4 rectangular pieces. Cut rectangles in half lengthwise so you have 8 narrow strips.</li>
            <li>Make a 2-inch slice through the center of one end of a hot dog. Cut two more 2-inch slices on either side of that, so that the 'legs' are about the same thickness. Repeat on the other end. Cut 'legs' into the remaining hot dogs.</li>
            <li>Roll a crescent strip around the center of each dog. Place spider dogs on an ungreased baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 11 minutes. Dip a chopstick into some ketchup and dot 'eyes' onto each spider. Serve with remaining ketchup.</li>
        </ol>
